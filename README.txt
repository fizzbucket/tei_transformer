#About

tei_transformer is a Python script for transforming a TEI-encoded critical edition into a pdf file. There are plenty of XSLT stylesheets to do something like this already, but using Python instead gives a secret advantage: we don't really lose out on anything, but it's unbelievably easy to customise things.

So what we have here is conceptually as much a framework for your own changes as something immediately usable (although it is.)
